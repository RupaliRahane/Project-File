# Project-File
    Regression Analysis on weather Forecast
# Aim:
    The goal of Regression Analysis on Weather Forecast is used for forecasting the minimum and maximum temp and wind speed


 # Objective of the project:
    In order to find the relationship among variables(here maximum temp rainfall and minimum temp,tec.)
    In order to estimate the values of some attributes so that new observations are entertained


# Methodology:
    The project is divided into following phases.each phase will require different tech field which the project encompasses
    Data Collection ,Data pre-processing, Data Processing,apply ML tech,Evaluating tech,deploy final result.


# Collect the initial Data:
    https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grubenm/austin-weather


# Tools and Technology Used:
    Python ,Linear regression
    Jupyter Notebook
    Python Libraries:pandas,numpy,matplotlib,seaborn
 
 
# Conclusion:
     The Most Scientific and technical challenging prbl around the worlds is forecasting the weather.weather prediction relies on two correct things :
     1) First the collection of the data from the meteorological department 
     2) The major cocerns of weather prediction are the accuracy of the model and timely output.
